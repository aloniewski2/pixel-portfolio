# CryptoArmor

Pre-Transaction Risk Intelligence Platform for Web3 Security

CryptoArmor is a real-time blockchain security tool that analyzes wallet addresses, transactions, and smart contracts to detect threats before they cause harm. Built for security researchers, developers, and crypto users who need to evaluate risk before interacting with on-chain entities.

## Features

### Transaction Risk Scanner
- Real-time calldata analysis for Ethereum transactions
- Contract verification status checks
- Token approval pattern detection (unlimited approvals, drainer contracts)
- Transaction history and failure rate analysis
- Account age and activity scoring

### Wallet Reputation Analysis
- Trust score calculation based on on-chain behavior
- Multi-factor risk assessment (age, volume, contract status, balance)
- Flag detection for suspicious patterns
- Recent transaction history with success/failure tracking
- Live data from Ethereum mainnet via Etherscan API

### Testnet Dashboard
- Support for Ethereum Sepolia, Holesky, and Bitcoin testnet
- Pre-configured wallet fixtures for testing (low-risk, high-risk, phishing, drainers)
- Read-only mode (no private keys, no signatures)
- RPC connection testing and health monitoring
- Mainnet address blocking for safety

### Attack Simulation
- Educational simulations of common attack vectors:
  - Approval drain attacks
  - Phishing contract interactions
  - Wallet impersonation
  - Honeypot token schemes
- Step-by-step attack walkthroughs
- Detection output visualization
- Linked testnet wallet analysis

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- State Management: TanStack Query
- Backend: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)
- APIs: Etherscan API, Public RPC endpoints
- Routing: React Router v6

## Architecture

# Clone the repository
git clone
cd cryptoarmor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
Environment Variables
Create a .env file with:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
For edge functions, configure:

ETHERSCAN_API_KEY - Etherscan API access
Usage
Quick Scan: Enter any Ethereum address on the homepage to analyze
Transaction Scanner: Paste transaction calldata for detailed risk analysis
Wallet Reputation: Deep-dive into wallet trust scores and history
Testnet Dashboard: Use pre-built fixtures or custom addresses for safe testing
Attack Simulation: Learn how common attacks work with step-by-step breakdowns
Security Principles
Read-Only: Never requests wallet signatures or initiates transactions
No Private Keys: Does not generate, store, or handle private keys
Testnet First: Simulation features exclusively use testnet data
Mainnet Blocking: Actively rejects mainnet addresses in testnet mode
